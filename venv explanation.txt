You may ask why there is .venv in our project, it's because it is an virtual environment.

A virtual environment in Python is an isolated environment on your computer, 
where you can run and test your Python projects. It allows you to manage project-specific 
dependencies without interfering with other projects or the original Python installation.
(Source: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_virtualenv.asp)

and to activate it (if it doesn't do it automatically), you need to put 
".venv\Scripts\activate" into your terminal. you can tell if it's activated
when there is a (.venv) in your terminal.

We are putting .venv in this project simply to get tensorflow working, since it
doesn't work well on certain versions of Python (I have 3.13 in my laptop).

commands for libraries (if necessary):
pip install ffpyplayer
pip install opencv-python
pip install tensorflow==2.12.0
